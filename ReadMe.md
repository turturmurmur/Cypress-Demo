This is done by Murat Erdem to demo some features of Cypress tool for automation purposes.
The tests are inside integration folder.
Plugins will have the mochawesome reporter installed for generating a report after running.

To start Cypress 'npx cypress open' or use the custom script done 'npm run cy:open' wait for it to open up and run as you like.
To run headless all the scripts 'npx cypress run' and it will create a report with mochawesome report. 

Initial typescript setup is done and some custom commands are included.
Prettier config is done and usable.

If wanted can be used to turn into a full framework with Cypress.
